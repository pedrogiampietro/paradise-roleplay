# Instructions

To setup this project, all you need to do is clone the repository.

1. Clone using SSH or HTTPS

    `git clone git@github.com:stuyy/discord-dashboard-react.git`

The package manager I used for this project, and use generally, is `yarn`. You may use `npm` if you wish however if you run into any issues with installing dependencies or building, consider switching to `yarn`.

2. `cd` into the cloned project, and then install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`. 

3. Run `npm start` or `yarn start`, this should start the project on `http://localhost:3000`.

In order to have the app fully working, you must have the NestJS API setup locally as well. Please visit the [Dashboard NestJS API](https://github.com/stuyy/discord-dashboard-api) project repository and go through the README for instructions on how to setup the Nest API for the dashboard.
